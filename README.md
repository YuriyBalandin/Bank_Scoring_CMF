# Bank_Scoring_CMF
The project was completed in the course of training on the program "Data Analysis" from the Center for Mathematical Finance of the National Research University Higher School of Economics. https://www.kaggle.com/c/2021-bank-scoring-case-2/overview

In the in-class competition on Kaggle, the solution took first place.

The project was carried out to a greater extent for educational purposes. Exploratory data analysis was carried out, new features were created, and different classes of models were tested. The best solution was obtained using several catboost models with hyperparameters obtained using oputna.
